Debugging~of large programs is a~difficult and time consuming task.
Given~a runtime error, the~developer must first reproduce it. 
He then has~to find the cause~of the~error and create a~bugfix.
This process can be made significantly more efficient by reducing 
the amount~of code the developer has~to look into. 
This paper introduces three different methodologies~of automatically reducing
a~given program $P$ into its minimal runnable subset $P'$.
The automatically generated program $P'$ also has~to result~in the~same runtime
error as~$P$.
The main focus~of the reduction is on~correctness when operating in a~concrete
application domain set by this study.
Implementations~of introduced methodologies written using the~LLVM compiler
infrastructure are then compared and classified.
Performance is measured based~on the statement count~of the~newly generated
program and the~speed at which the~minimal variant was generated.
Moreover, the~limits of the~three different approaches are investigated
with respect~to~the general application domain.
The~paper concludes with an~overview~of the~most general and efficient methodology.
