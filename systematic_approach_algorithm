An algorithm for systematic reduction of a "general domain" program `P`:

Prerequisites: 
    While running, the program `P` results in a runtime error `E`. Using a stack trace analysis tool, the user can tell which line of code `L` caused the runtime error and what the nature of the runtime error was, i.e. its description `D`.

Input: 
    The source code of the program `P`, line `L` on which the error `E` was thrown, the description `D` of the error `E`, the arguments `A` with which the error `E` was produced.

# Get the error line in the AST.
1. T <- GetAST(P)
2. STM <- T.VisitLine(L)
3. V <- EmptyVariableList
# Collect all variables in the error line.
4. for each EXPR in STM:
5.	    if EXPR is Variable:
6.		    V <- V + EXPR
7. S <- EmptySliceList
# Get slices w.r.t. each collected error line variable.
8. for each VAR in V:
9.      S <- S + StaticSlice(P, STM, VAR)
# Unify those slice, i.e. create a slice w.r.t. all collected error line variables.
10. SLC <- Unify(S)
11. P' <- Compile(SLC)
12. T <- GetAST(P')
# Get all variables in the new program variant and consider only those arguments that are still present in the new program variant.
13. V' <- MatchVariables(T')
14. A <- Intersect(A, V')
15. S <- EmptySliceList
# Get slices w.r.t. each collected error line variable.
16. for each VAR in V:
17.	    S <- S + DynamicSlice(P', STM, VAR, A)
# Unify those slice, i.e. create a slice w.r.t. all collected error line variables.
18. SLC <- Unify(S)
19. P' <- Compile(SLC)
# Launch a more precise debugging approach on the reduced program variant.
20. P' <- Delta(P', STM, A)

Output: The minimal runnable program variant `P'` that produces runtime error `E` with the description `D`.

Explanation of used functions and procedures:
    GetAST: Gets an in-memory representation of the AST of a given program using LLVM.
    Tree.VisitLine: A custom function that recursivelly visits the statement on a given line in the AST.
    StaticSlice: A function that produces a static slice w.r.t. a given statement and variable. [F. Tip 1.1, J. Silva 2.2, 2.4]
    DynamicSlice: Same as StaticSlice, however it produces a dynamic slice provided an argument list. [J. Silva 2.3]
    Unify: Unifies given slices to form a single slice that contains all statements in those given slices.
    Intersect: Returns only those variables present in both given lists.
    Compile: Compiles a given code / AST / slice using clang.
    Delta: Launches previously implemented delta debugging onto a given program.

Limitations of the algorithm: 
    The algorithm is not designed to work with multithreaded and interprocess programs. The support for this kind of a domain can be achieved by altering the algorithm. This would however generally result in a larger `P'`.
    The algorithm is not guaranteed to work with non-terminating applications, although it is designed to work in this kind of a domain in some cases.
